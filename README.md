### Android Mortgage Calculator 

Create a mortgage calculator app that allows the user to enter a purchase price, down payment amount, and an interest rate.

Based on these values, the app should calculate the loan amount (*purchase price minus down payment*) and display the monthly payment for 10, 20, and 30 year loans.

Allow the user to select a custom loan duration (in years) by using a SeekBar and display the monthly payment for that custom loan duration.
